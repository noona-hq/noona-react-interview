# Noona React Interview
This is a very simple and raw React repository, initialized using Vite's react-ts template.
Along with the defaults from the template, we've set up the following:
1. Noona's API Typescript client that uses react-query (genereted by orval.dev)
2. @emotion/react and @emotion/styled for CSS. This is completely optional to use, feel free to use whatever you feel comfortable with.

Adding new packages is of course welcome. 

## Get started
1. Clone this repo
2. Get an NPM_TOKEN from the Noona team and add to your environment. We recommend using a tool like direnv to keep tokens like these organized. 
3. Run `yarn (install)`
4. Run `yarn dev`
